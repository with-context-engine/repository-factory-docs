##  üëã Welcome

> [!Info]
> So, you've decided to level up your üêç game by installing a sense of formalism in your `dev` experience. Great! I'm excited for you. These docs will assist you in customizing [the repository factory](https://github.com/with-context-engine/repository-factory) to your specific needs and desired experience. 

## üèõÔ∏è Repository *ethos*

We've all been there. Running `git init` and then ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è immediately thereafter. Questions like: 

1. Ok now how do I organize my python environment? 
2. Where do I place my files so that I can train, serve, deploy, or create something with python? 
3. Do I have the right dependencies? 
4. What about all the `bash` customizations I should use? 
5. Once I've got my ML code built, where do I go to train the model? 
6. How do I integrate these deployed tools (ML model, Streamlit app, FastAPI, etc., into my DevOps's environment?)
7. Whats a really clever way to involve CI/CD in this whole process so that I don't write brittle code? 

The list goes on and on. Finally, if you're interested in building actual machine learning *product prototypes*, you often wonder what's the best way to string together all these components? Well, that's the pain I've felt too.

## Solution Architecture

This diagram documents how this repository behaves. It shows how all the components work together to form the basics of a modern ML application prototype. This repository can customize itself six different ways via `Cruft` and `Cookiecutter`, resulting in a single repo that can create six different versions of itself to meet needs on both sides of the solution.Ô∏è

### Pre-requisites

You will need an active working knowledge of `git`, AWS, [DVC](http://dvc.org), and [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/) in order to fully leverage this resource for your own benefit.
