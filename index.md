##  👋 Hello

So, you've decided to level up your 🐍 game by installing a sense of formalism in your `dev` experience. Great! I'm excited for you. These docs will assist you in customizing [the repository factory](https://github.com/with-context-engine/repository-factory) to your specific needs and desired experience. 

### Pre-requisites

You will need an active working knowledge of `git`, AWS, [DVC](dvc.org), and [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/) in order to fully leverage this resource for your own benefit.
